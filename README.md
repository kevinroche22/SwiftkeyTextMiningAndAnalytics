# Next Word Prediction App

This repository houses the code written for Johns Hopkins University's Data Science Specialization capstone project.

The goal of the project was to create an app that predicts the next word in a sentence, which you can try out [here.](https://kevinroche22.shinyapps.io/nextWordPredictionApp/)

This raw data was cleaned, visualized, and modeled using the following scripts:

- [01 - dataProcessing.R](https://github.com/kevinroche22/nextWordPredictionApp/blob/main/scripts/01%20-%20dataProcessing.R)
- [02 - exploratoryDataAnalysis.R](https://github.com/kevinroche22/nextWordPredictionApp/blob/main/scripts/02%20-%20exploratoryDataAnalysis.R)
- [03 - sboModeling.R](https://github.com/kevinroche22/nextWordPredictionApp/blob/main/scripts/03%20-%20sboModeling.R)

If you need further instruction on how to use the app, you can check out the slide deck [here.](https://rpubs.com/kevinroche22/nextWordPredictionAppPresentation)
